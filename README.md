# Multi-Signature Wallet

A secure and decentralized multi-signature wallet smart contract built with Solidity and Hardhat, designed for enhanced security and collaborative fund management.

## Project Description

The Multi-Signature Wallet is a smart contract that requires multiple signatures (confirmations) from designated owners before executing any transaction. This eliminates single points of failure and provides enhanced security for digital asset management. The contract allows multiple parties to jointly control funds, ensuring that no single individual can unilaterally access or transfer assets.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a robust, transparent, and secure multi-signature wallet solution that empowers organizations, DAOs, and groups to manage their digital assets collaboratively. By implementing multi-signature functionality, we aim to:

- **Enhance Security**: Eliminate single points of failure by requiring multiple approvals
- **Promote Transparency**: All transactions and approvals are recorded on-chain
- **Enable Collaboration**: Allow multiple parties to jointly manage funds safely
- **Build Trust**: Provide a trustless solution for group fund management

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Owner Management**: Support for multiple wallet owners with configurable approval thresholds
- **Transaction Proposal System**: Owners can propose transactions that require group approval
- **Flexible Confirmation Requirements**: Configurable number of confirmations needed (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5)

### Security Features
- **Access Control**: Only designated owners can propose and approve transactions
- **Transaction Validation**: Comprehensive checks before transaction execution
- **Revocation Capability**: Owners can revoke their confirmations before execution
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Built-in protection against common smart contract vulnerabilities

### Core Functions
1. **`submitTransaction()`**: Propose a new transaction for group approval
2. **`confirmTransaction()`**: Approve a pending transaction
3. **`executeTransaction()`**: Execute a transaction once it has sufficient confirmations

### Additional Features
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for transaction tracking
- **Balance Tracking**: Real-time wallet balance monitoring
- **Transaction History**: Complete history of all proposed and executed transactions
- **Owner Management**: View and manage wallet owners

## Future Scope

### Short-term Enhancements
- **Mobile Integration**: Develop mobile applications for easier wallet management
- **Gas Optimization**: Implement gas-efficient patterns to reduce transaction costs
- **Batch Transactions**: Allow multiple transactions to be proposed and executed together
- **Time-based Execution**: Add time delays for high-value transactions

### Medium-term Features
- **Role-based Permissions**: Different permission levels for different types of transactions
- **Spending Limits**: Daily/monthly spending limits with different approval requirements
- **Integration APIs**: REST APIs for integration with external applications
- **Advanced Analytics**: Transaction analytics and reporting dashboard

### Long-term Vision
- **Cross-chain Compatibility**: Support for multiple blockchain networks
- **DeFi Integration**: Direct integration with DeFi protocols for yield farming and lending
- **Governance Module**: Built-in governance features for decentralized decision making
- **Insurance Integration**: Optional insurance coverage for wallet funds
- **Hardware Wallet Support**: Integration with hardware wallet providers

### Enterprise Features
- **Compliance Tools**: KYC/AML integration for enterprise customers
- **Audit Trail**: Enhanced audit capabilities for regulatory compliance
- **White-label Solutions**: Customizable wallet solutions for enterprises
- **Professional Services**: Consulting and implementation services

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd multi-signature-wallet
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your private key (without 0x prefix)
   - Configure network settings

4. **Compile the contract**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

5. **Deploy to Core Testnet 2**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Usage

### Deploying the Contract
```bash
# Deploy to Core Testnet 2
npm run deploy

# Deploy to local network
npm run deploy-local
```

### Interacting with the Contract

1. **Submit a Transaction**
   ```solidity
   submitTransaction(recipientAddress, amount, data)
   ```

2. **Confirm a Transaction**
   ```solidity
   confirmTransaction(transactionIndex)
   ```

3. **Execute a Transaction**
   ```solidity
   executeTransaction(transactionIndex)
   ```

## Network Configuration

The project is configured to deploy on Core Testnet 2:
- **RPC URL**: https://rpc.test2.btcs.network
- **Chain ID**: 1115
- **Gas Price**: 20 gwei

## Security Considerations

- Always use hardware wallets for mainnet deployments
- Verify all owner addresses before deployment
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment
- Keep private keys secure and never commit them to version control
- Regularly audit the contract code
